# StellarID Identity Flow Documentation

This document explains the complete user journey for creating and building a digital identity with StellarID, from initial registration to accessing financial services.

## Identity Creation Process

The StellarID identity system is designed with progressive identity building in mind, allowing users to start with minimal information and gradually build a more complete digital identity as they collect attestations.

### 1. Initial Account Creation

When a user first interacts with StellarID, they go through the following steps:

1. **Download the StellarID mobile application**
   - Available on iOS and Android app stores
   - Optimized for low-end devices with minimal storage requirements

2. **Create a new Stellar account**
   - A new Stellar keypair is generated on the device
   - The public key becomes the user's unique identifier
   - The secret key is securely stored on the device using platform-specific security features
