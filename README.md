StellarID is a decentralized identity solution built on the Stellar blockchain that enables individuals without traditional documentation to establish verifiable digital identities. This project aims to address one of the fundamental barriers to financial inclusion by providing a pathway for the unbanked and underserved populations to access financial services.

## üåü Project Overview

According to the World Bank, approximately 1 billion people globally lack official identification, making it impossible for them to access basic financial services. StellarID tackles this challenge by creating a self-sovereign identity platform where individuals can progressively build their digital identity through a network of trusted attesters.

### Core Features

- **Progressive Identity Building**: Users start with minimal information and gradually build verifiable credentials
- **Multi-tier Verification System**: Different levels of identity verification to accommodate various user situations
- **Privacy-Preserving Credentials**: Selective disclosure of identity attributes using cryptographic techniques
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for smartphones with offline capability for areas with limited connectivity
- **Integration Framework**: APIs for financial services providers to verify identities with user consent

## üöÄ Technical Architecture

StellarID leverages the Stellar blockchain's unique features to create a secure, decentralized identity system:

### Blockchain Layer
- **Custom Assets for Credentials**: Using Stellar's asset issuance functionality to create tamper-proof credential tokens
- **Attestation Registry**: A decentralized registry of trusted attesters using Stellar's smart contract capabilities
- **Claimable Balances**: Using Stellar's claimable balances feature for conditional credential issuance
- **Multi-signature Accounts**: For creating governance structures around credential validation

### Application Layer
- **Mobile App**: A React Native application for users to manage their digital identities
- **Attester Portal**: Web interface for attesters to review and issue credentials
- **API Server**: Backend services connecting the application with the Stellar blockchain
- **IPFS Integration**: For storing encrypted identity documents off-chain

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Smart Contracts on Stellar

StellarID utilizes Stellar's Turing Signing Servers (TSS) for implementing the identity registry and attestation management logic. The smart contracts handle:

1. Identity creation and registration
2. Credential issuance and verification
3. Attestation management
4. Privacy-preserving disclosures

### Mobile Application

The mobile application is built with React Native, providing a cross-platform solution that works on both Android and iOS devices. Key features of the app include:

1. Secure key management using device-level encryption
2. QR code scanning for identity verification
3. Offline capability for use in areas with limited connectivity
4. Step-by-step guidance for building identity credentials
5. Simple interface for requesting attestations

### Backend Services

The backend API server provides:

1. Integration with the Stellar blockchain
2. IPFS document storage and retrieval
3. Attestation request management
4. Identity verification services for third parties

## üìã Project Justification

StellarID addresses the "Better Access" track by focusing on identity solutions that increase accessibility and inclusion in the financial system. The project:

1. **Removes Barriers**: Enables individuals without traditional documentation to establish trusted digital identities
2. **Promotes Inclusion**: Creates pathways for the unbanked to access financial services
3. **Empowers Users**: Gives individuals control over their identity and privacy
4. **Builds Trust**: Creates a network of verifiable credentials through trusted attesters

## üìö API Documentation

API documentation is available at [https://api.stellarid.io/docs](https://api.stellarid.io/docs) (demo link) and also in the `/docs` folder of this repository.

## üîç Use Cases

### 1. Refugee Identity

Refugees who have lost their documentation can build a new digital identity through a network of trusted attesters, including NGOs, camp administrators, and international organizations.

### 2. Rural Banking Access

Individuals in rural areas without access to traditional banking infrastructure can build a digital identity to access microfinance services, mobile banking, and digital payments.

### 3. Informal Economy Workers

Workers in the informal economy can build verifiable employment histories and financial credentials to access credit and other financial services.
